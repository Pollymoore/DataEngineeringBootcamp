"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide

"Tsunami"

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"You Stole The Sun From My Heart"

Drinking - water to stay thin
Or is it to purify
I love you all the same

But there's no - no real truce with my fury
You don't have to believe me
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same

I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth
So much so I woke up
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

"The Everlasting"

The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiving the everlasting
Everlasting

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

Now unforgiving, the everlasting

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart

You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same

I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart

You stole the sun from

Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth
So much so I woke up

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiving the everlasting
Everlasting

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists

Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart

You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer

But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

I don't believe in it anymore

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die

Holding onto me forever

Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise

I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide

Holding onto me forever

Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide

Holding onto me forever

Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever

Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die

Holding onto me forever

Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

"The Everlasting"

The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"

The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired

Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"You Stole The Sun From My Heart"

Drinking - water to stay thin
Or is it to purify
I love you all the same

But there's no - no real truce with my fury
You don't have to believe me
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same

I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from

Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth
So much so I woke up

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

"The Everlasting"

The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning

"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"

The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"You Stole The Sun From My Heart"

Drinking - water to stay thin
Or is it to purify
I love you all the same

But there's no - no real truce with my fury
You don't have to believe me
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same

I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart

Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

"The Everlasting"

The gap that grows between our lives

Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning

"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"

The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits

Bullets for your brain today

Monuments put from pen to paper

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

"Tsunami"

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"You Stole The Sun From My Heart"

Drinking - water to stay thin
Or is it to purify
I love you all the same

But there's no - no real truce with my fury
You don't have to believe me
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same

I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from

Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth
So much so I woke up
I love you all the same

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

"The Everlasting"

The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiving the everlasting

Shed some skin for the fear within

Freed from the memory
Escape from our history, history

I look to the future it makes me cry
But it seems too real to tell you why

Freed from the century

"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"

The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
Drift away and die

Drift away and die

Drift away and die

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists

Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

"Tsunami"

For you my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tells me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing girl
Cry into my drink I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami tsunami

In - between, in - between, in - between, in - between

"You Stole The Sun From My Heart"

Drinking - water to stay thin
Or is it to purify
I love you all the same

But there's no - no real truce with my fury
You don't have to believe me
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same

I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth
So much so I woke up
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

I have - I've got to stop smiling
It gives the wrong impression
I love you all the same

"Ready For Drowning"

Here's a true story
Said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning

"The Everlasting"

The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiven the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiving the everlasting
Everlasting

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

Now unforgiving, the everlasting
Everlasting

But now unforgiving, the everlasting

"New Art Riot"

Vintage aromas and vintage ideals
Old men greying to a dying country's needs
Waiting for a knighthood to while away the hours
Listen and learn now it's time to kill your betters

Museums are dead take a new art stance
Paint mass suicide on the aspiration diktat

Hospital closure kills more than car bombs ever will
But it saves money because people are expendable
You cold shoulder insurgents yet love arms dealers
Everybody's taking drugs as it makes governing easier

Museums are dead take a new art stance
Paint mass suicide on the aspiration diktat
Sell out the past and learn to obey
You spit out and douse a Molotov cocktail

Revolution soon dies sold out for a pay rise
China, Russia, England, all washed up in power abuse
Terrorism is an excuse that the ruling class use
Wipe out aristocracy now kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

England makes judgements of old school propaganda
The only threat to heads is silenced by dumb pleasure
Museums are dead take a new art stance
Paint mass suicide on the aspiration diktat

Play "Motorcycle Emptine…"
on Amazon Music Unlimited (ad)
"Motorcycle Emptiness"

Culture sucks down words
Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
Organise your safe tribal war
Hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto

Each day living out a lie
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

Life lies a slow suicide
Orthodox dreams and symbolic myths
From feudal serf to spender
This wonderful world of purchase power

Just like lungs sucking on air
Survivals natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

All we want from you are the kicks you've given us
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us

Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

Drive away and it's the same
Everywhere death row, everyone's a victim
Your joys are counterfeit
This happiness corrupt political shit

Living life like a comatose
Ego loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow

Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness

"You Love Us"

We are not your sinners
Our voices are for real
We realised and won't be mourned
We gonna burn your deathmask uniforms

We won't die of devotion
Understand we can never belong
Throw some acid into your face
Pollute your mineral water with a strychnine taste

You love us
You love us
You love us
You love
You love us
Oh you love us
You love
You love us
You love us
You love

'Til I see love in statues
Your lessons drill inherited sin
Parliaments a fake life saver
You better wake up and smell the real flavour

You love us like a holocaust
Same P.R. problem as E.S.T.
You love us like a holocaust
Same P.R. problem as E.S.T.

You love us

"Stay Beautiful"

Find your faith in your security
All broken up at seventeen
Jam your brain with broken heroes
Love your masks and adore your failure

We're a mess of eyeliner and spraypaint
D.I.Y. destruction on chanel chic
Deny your culture of consumption
This is a culture of destruction

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just

Babes on the run with poisoned lips
Wrap your arms round this everlasting kiss
Clinging to your own sense of waste
All we love is lonely wreckage

Your school your dole and your chequebook dreams
Your clothes your suits and your pension schemes
Now you say you know how we feel
But don't fall in love cos we hate you still

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just

Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Anxiety is freedom

"Everything Must Go"

Shed some skin for the fear within
Is starting to hurt me with everything

Freed from the memory
Escape from our history, history

And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go

And if you need an explanation
Then everything must go

I look to the future it makes me cry
But it seems too real to tell you why

Freed from the century
With nothing but memory, memory

And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go

And if you need an explanation
Then everything must go

Freed us eventually just need to be happy, happy

And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go

And if you need an explanation
Then everything must go

And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go

And if you need an explanation, -nation
Then everything must go

"A Design For Life"

Libraries gave us power
Then work came and made us free
What price now for a shallow piece of dignity

I wish I had a bottle
Right here in my dirty face to wear the scars
To show from where I came

We don't talk about love we only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end

A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life

I wish I had a bottle
Right here in my pretty face to wear the scars
To show from where I came

We don't talk about love we only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end

A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life

We don't talk about love we only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end

A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
A design for...

"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"

The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young and being so vain

Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked La Ramblas
But not with real intent

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next

And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next

"You're Tender And You're Tired"

You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
